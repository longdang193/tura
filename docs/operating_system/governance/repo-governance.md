# Repository Governance

## Purpose

Define durable ownership boundaries for private development, reusable agent methods, planning artifacts, generated runtime surfaces, starter-kit output, and curated public publication.

## Repository Roles

### Private Source Repository

`project-OS-starter` is development source of truth. It may contain internal governance, planning history, private analysis tools, generated provider adapters, and publication tooling.

### Starter Kit

`generated_exports/project-OS-starter-kit` is generated consume-only output.
Build it from `repo_config/starter-kit-manifest.json`; do not author changes
directly in generated output or maintain a separate sibling kit copy.

### Public Repository

Public repository receives curated product-facing output through publication procedure. It is not a mirror of private repository.

## Ownership Layers

- `AGENTS.md`: repo-wide agent baseline.
- `docs/operating_system/rules/`: hard invariants.
- `.agents/skills/`: reusable methods with enough operational detail to execute correctly.
- `docs/operating_system/prompt_templates/`: reusable invocation wording.
- `docs/operating_system/planning/`: planning-tier and routing policy.
- `docs/operating_system/publication/`: publication policy and rewrite guidance.
- `docs/operating_system/procedures/`: maintainer commands and runbooks.
- `repo_config/`: actively consumed repository, starter-kit, adapter, planning-schema, and publication configuration.
- code, tests, configuration, and validators: executable truth.

Do not duplicate one behavior across several layers. References do not justify preserving an otherwise dead layer.

## Skill Governance

A skill owns one reusable method. Description exists for discovery; body contains full method, inputs, ordered steps, guardrails, outputs, and verification.

- Keep specialized high-use methods when consolidation would remove important detail.
- Merge only genuinely overlapping activation surfaces.
- Do not replace substantive bodies with short routing summaries.
- Keep mandatory `required_reads` only when skill cannot function correctly without that source.
- Use conditional reads for optional templates, governance, or tooling.
- Remove metadata without an active runtime or validator consumer.

Canonical planning and delivery skills are:

- `skill-spec-drafting`: author behavioral and interface specifications.
- `skill-writing-plans`: convert approved design into executable tasks.
- `skill-plan-document-reviewer`: review specification and plan readiness.
- `skill-using-git-worktrees`: create optional isolated workspace and record workspace identity.
- `skill-executing-plans`: execute approved plan tasks with task-local proof.
- `skill-verification-before-completion`: reconcile final scope and produce verified, incomplete, or blocked result.
- `skill-finishing-a-development-branch`: perform explicitly authorized Git disposition and safe workspace cleanup.

## Planning Ownership

- Approved user scope, issues, or optional roadmap items may own intent.
- Roadmaps optionally own coordinated direction across several outcomes.
- Brainstorming reports optionally own exploratory options, trade-offs, recommendations, and unresolved questions.
- Specifications own approved behavior, interfaces, decisions, invariants, acceptance criteria, and validation intent.
- Plans own ordered implementation tasks, exact files, commands, dependencies, execution approach, parallel-safe lanes, shared-write controls, required skills, and verification.
- Execution skills own implementation; verification and branch-finishing skills own evidence and authorized Git disposition.
- Validators validate artifacts that exist; they do not require a planning ladder.

No artifact is required merely to connect two other artifacts. Create only the
smallest artifact needed for safe execution. Local, reversible, design-clear
work may move directly from approved intent to execution and verification.

No persistent planning-lineage generator is required. Historical completed
plans remain evidence, not active instructions.

## Git-Tracked Coordination

Git-tracked multi-task work uses the active plan plus Git as durable recovery
state. Runtime threads, agent sessions, and temporary progress artifacts never
become repository coordination authority.

Canonical policy:
`docs/operating_system/rules/git-tracked-coordination-rule.md`.

## Generated Surfaces

Canonical sources are edited directly; generated surfaces are regenerated.

- `.agents/skills/` is canonical skill source.
- `docs/operating_system/rules/` and rules are canonical governance sources.
- `generated_agents/` contains provider packaging.
- `.agents/rules/` is generated from canonical rules for supported local runtimes.
- `generated_exports/project-OS-starter-kit/` is disposable starter output.

If generated output conflicts with canonical source, fix source or mapping and regenerate. Never maintain both manually.

## Code Intelligence

Use native tools for local work, Serena for exact symbols and references, `semble_codebase_search` for unknown-location code discovery, and `ast_grep_preview` for structural preview when available. Use private read-only GitNexus for broad flows or impact only when available and fresh. Do not query multiple tools for the same fact by default. Source and tests win every conflict; optional tooling never blocks safe work.

Detailed policy lives in `docs/operating_system/tooling/code-intelligence-tools.md`.

## Agent Memory

Configured MCP Memory Server stores verified reusable lessons outside repository when active executor exposes it. Under `dcode-project`, Codex handles required memory calls and passes validated handoff facts. Use it conditionally for recorded invariants, recurring failures, resumed work, or known operational constraints. Memory never overrides source, tests, ADRs, current governance, or explicit instructions.

Canonical policy: `docs/operating_system/rules/agent-memory-rule.md`.

## Publication Boundary

- Private repository remains source of truth.
- Build public export in disposable location.
- Publish only allowlisted content.
- Exclude private governance, MCP memory data and backups, local tool state, credentials, internal audits, and private generated indexes.
- Run dry-run verification and inspect export before push.
- Push only with explicit authorization.

Detailed policy lives in `docs/operating_system/publication/public-repo-publication-policy.md`. Procedure lives in `docs/operating_system/procedures/publication-procedure.md`.

## Configuration Governance

Keep only configuration with an active consumer. `repo_config/` currently owns:

- `planning_artifact_schema.yaml`
- `publication-config.json`
- `starter-kit-manifest.json`

Runtime settings for a particular adopted project belong in that project, not in this starter factory unless shipped behavior actively consumes them.

## Validation and Closeout

Use `scripts/validate_repo_contracts.py` as canonical repository contract command. Run focused checks first, then broad checks appropriate to changed scope.

When changing agent sources or generated adapter ownership:

1. validate metadata
2. regenerate all adapters
3. verify adapter drift
4. rebuild and validate starter kit
5. run publication dry run when boundary-sensitive content changed
6. search for stale paths and deleted names
7. run `git diff --check`

Completion claims require fresh evidence. Do not weaken validators to preserve deleted architecture or arbitrary inventory targets.
